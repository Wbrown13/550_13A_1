## Introduction

This page shows images from a sample article I wrote for the Foreign Policy policy website. While a researcher in China, I frequently pitched articles to Foreign Policy editors to convey trends about the country's development to a wider audience. Many of these pieces relied on data-driven maps that I made at home with QGIS.

The images below come from [this article on China's unequal regional development](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/05/12/mapping-the-four-cs-of-chinese-wealth/). Not all of the maps load reliably on Foreign Policy's web page, so I am reproducing them below (with FP's permission).

This first image is a context-setting map to demonstrate which parts of the country have higher-than-average incomes.

## Urbanization

This pair of maps shows the extent to which above-average incomes correlate with high urbanization rates.

## Coastal location

![alt-text]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/FP4.png)
These two maps demonstrate how prefectures with above-average incomes tend to hug the coast, while inland prefectures of the same provinces often are left behind.

## Provincial capitals

![alt-text]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/FP5.png)
This map shows how even capital cities of poor provinces usually have incomes well above average.

## Coal and other natural resources

The final map demonstrates how richer-than-average prefectures that do not fall into the above categories often benefit from large deposits of valued natural resources.
