This is my first attempt embedding static and interactive charts on static websites like Github pages. I am using a template repository from an online class. 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
def print_message(message):
  print(message)

print_message("Welcome to GitHub Pages")
```

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
