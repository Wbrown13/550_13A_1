## Introduction

This article contains images of maps made in my previous role as a researcher in China. Our team initially did not use GIS to present data for clients, but I promoted the practice over time and prepared many visualizations and analyses to demonstrate its utility. Some samples from our public reports are shown below.

## China retail sales

This animating map was inserted into many of our firm's Powerpoint presentations to illustrate the scale of China's retail market, and the degree to which it fanned out across the country in just a few decades.

## City-level vacancy

We also made regularly updated maps to visualize where vacancy in certain property markets was distributed around the country.

## Emergence of new property markets

This map animation demonstrates how high-quality assets in a specific property class grew from a limited presence in 2005 to spread across Shanghai and beyond in later years. This map was a key component of our regular presentations, helping convey to clients the scale of the market in and nearby Shanghai.

## Other maps
My team produced many other GIS visualizations and analyses during my time there. While I cannot post them publicly here, I would be happy to discuss them further upon request.
