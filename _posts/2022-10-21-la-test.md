## Hvplot Example 1

Below is a heatmap that shows 311 requests in New Orleans, by request type. You can use the dropdown menu to switch between types.

<div id="hv-chart-1"></div>

This was produced using hvplot and embedded into this static web page. 

## HvPlot Example 2

Below is a map of New Orleans 311 requests. You can use the dropdown menu to switch between types of requests.

<div id="hv-chart-2"></div>

**Important, when embedding charts, you will likely need to adjust the width/height of the charts before embedding them in the page so they
fit nicely when embedded.
